# Handwritten Character Recognition

This repository implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for recognizing handwritten **characters**. The project uses a custom dataset (or a publicly available character dataset, depending on your implementation) and is built with **Python**, **Keras**, and **OpenCV**.

## Project Overview

Handwritten character recognition is a challenging and essential task in optical character recognition (OCR). The model in this project is designed to identify **alphabetic characters** accurately using deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, which are well-suited for image classification tasks.

### Features
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes CNN for recognizing handwritten characters.
- **Preprocessing**: Preprocessed character images using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** for noise reduction and better feature extraction.
- **High Accuracy**: Optimized CNN model that efficiently recognizes handwritten characters.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, MediaPipe.

## Requirements

To run the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

This project uses a dataset of handwritten characters. You can either use a public dataset like EMNIST (Extended MNIST for characters) or a custom one depending on the scope of the project.

- **Training Set**: Handwritten alphabet characters from A-Z.
- **Test Set**: A separate set of characters for model evaluation.


## Results

The model can recognize handwritten alphabet characters with **high accuracy**. Depending on the dataset used, the model's performance varies, but it is tuned to provide optimal results for most common datasets (like EMNIST).

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements for this project:
- Expand the model to recognize more complex characters or symbols.
- Deploy the model via a web app for real-time handwriting recognition.
- Fine-tune the model for multilingual character recognition.
